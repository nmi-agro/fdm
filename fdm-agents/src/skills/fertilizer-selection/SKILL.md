# Fertilizer Selection and Application

## Planning Workflow

Follow this sequence for every plan:

1. **Call `getFarmFields`** to get field list, crops, soil types
2. **Call `getFarmNutrientAdvice`** for all non-buffer fields → get `d_n_req`, `d_p_req`, `d_k_req` per field
3. **Call `searchFertilizers`** to know what products are available (returns slim summary: key macronutrients + OM + NH₃ factor)
   - Call **`getFertilizerDetails`** with specific `p_id_catalogue` values when you need secondary/micro nutrients (S, Mg, Ca, Cu, Zn, B) for a chosen product
4. **Draft applications** using organic/manure products first (they provide OM + some nutrients)
5. **Call `simulateFarmPlan`** with ALL non-buffer fields in the `fields` array — never a subset. Every field must have its own entry, even if it shares a cultivation with another field. The simulation returns `fieldMetrics.proposedDose` and `fieldMetrics.advice` per field
6. **Compute gaps** per field: `advice.d_n_req - proposedDose.p_dose_nw` (N), `d_p_req - p_dose_p` (P), `d_k_req - p_dose_k` (K)
7. **Close remaining gaps** with mineral fertilizers (subject to legal norms and `s_organic`)
8. **Re-simulate** after adding top-up products to verify all gaps are closed and norms not exceeded
9. Repeat 2–5 times, until gaps are ≤ 5 kg N/ha or norm ceiling prevents further application

See `nutrient-advice-targeting` skill for detailed gap-closing logic and the N/OM trade-off.



Prefer to use the same fertilizers for fields with the same or similar cultivations to simplify farm operations.

## Full Nutrient Coverage

Beyond N, P, and K, check and fulfill advice for secondary nutrients (Ca, Mg, S) and micro-nutrients (Cu, Zn, B, Mn, Mo, Co) using appropriate fertilizers. Monitor `advice` (required) vs `proposedDose` (supplied) from `fieldMetrics` in the simulation tool.

Always compare `proposedDose.p_dose_nw` (werkzame stikstof, kg/ha) against `advice.d_n_req` for nitrogen — this is the agronomically correct workable-N value. `p_dose_n` is total N and is provided for reference only.

## Application Method

For each application, propose a valid `p_app_method`. Choose **only** from the `p_app_method_options` returned by the search tool for that specific fertilizer.

## Realistic Application Amounts (`p_app_amount` always in kg/ha)

Equipment limits determine maximum amounts per application:

| Fertilizer type | Per-application range | Unit conversion |
|--|--|--|
| Slurry / drijfmest / digestaat | 15,000–30,000 kg/ha | 1 m³ = 1,000 kg; round to nearest 1,000 |
| Solid manure / vaste mest / compost | 10,000–30,000 kg/ha | 1 t = 1,000 kg; round to nearest 1,000 |
| Mineral fertilizers | 50–1,000 kg/ha | already in kg/ha; round to nearest 5 or 10 |

If the total advice requires more, **split into multiple applications** on different dates.

## Realistic Application Dates

Ensure all `p_app_date` values are realistic for the crop type, cultivation season, and Dutch climate. Use `b_lu_start` (sowing/start date) as the critical reference point for each crop.

## Ammonia Reduction Strategy

If NH₃ reduction is requested, prioritize fertilizers and application methods with lower ammonia emission factors (`p_ef_nh3`). Prefer "incorporation" or "injection" over "broadcasting" where the fertilizer allows it.

## Manure Space Strategy

- **Fill Manure Space YES**: Maximize manure applications up to the farm-level legal norm, even if it exceeds agronomic advice or field-level norms (as long as farm total is compliant). Prefer regionally common manures (e.g. Rundveedrijfmest).
- **Fill Manure Space NO**: Use manure only as needed for agronomic advice and organic matter balance.

## Buffer Strips

Fields with `b_bufferstrip: true` **MUST NOT** receive any fertilizer applications. Ensure zero applications for these fields and do not include them in the plan output.

## Every Field Must Appear in the Plan

**Every non-bufferstrip field must have an entry in the output plan** — including fields that share a cultivation type with a larger field. Do not skip or omit smaller fields. If two fields have the same cultivation and the same application plan, duplicate the application entries for both fields explicitly. Never plan only for the largest representative field.

## Rotation Level (Bouwplan)

If `workOnRotationLevel` is YES, group fields by `b_lu_catalogue` value and assign identical applications (same `p_id_catalogue`, `p_app_amount`, `p_app_date`, `p_app_method`) to every field within the same group. For grassland variations (`nl_265`, `nl_266`, `nl_331`), treat them as one group. Every individual field in the group still needs its own entry in the output.
